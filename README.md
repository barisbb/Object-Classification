# Object-Classification-

In this project, I trained a CNN using Pytorch. Different techniques and methods were implemented to boost the accuracy. There are 3 files in the project:

model.py

-The CNN architecture was implemented to the file.

main.py

-The training was done in this file using training set. At the end of the training, the trained model was saved to the current directory. Also, TSNE and graphs were implemented.

eval.py

-After the training, the model was tested with the trained model using test set. 

Initially, you need to run the main.py to start the training. Then, you need to run the eval.py to see the test accuracy.
